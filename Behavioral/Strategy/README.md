## When to use Strategy Pattern ?

- When you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
- When you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.

## Advantages of Strategy Pattern

- Algorithms used inside an object can be swapped at runtime.
- Isolation of the implementation details of an algorithm from the code that uses it.

## Disadvantages of Strategy Pattern

- Thereâ€™s no real reason to overcomplicate the program with new classes and interfaces that come along with the pattern, if there are only couple of algorithms and they rarely change.

### How to run ?

- Run `AnimalPlay.java`.
