## When to use Interpreter Pattern ?

- When it is needed to convert one representation of data into another.

## Advantages of Interpreter Pattern

- Itâ€™s easy to change and extend the grammar. Because the pattern uses classes to represent grammar rules, you can use inheritance to change or extend the grammar. Existing expressions can be modified incrementally, and new expressions can be defined as variations on old ones.
- Implementing the grammar is easy, too. Classes defining nodes in the abstract syntax tree have similar implementations. These classes are easy to write, and often their generation can be automated with a compiler or parser generator.

## Disadvantages of Interpreter Pattern

- Complex grammars are hard to maintain. The Interpreter pattern defines at least one class for every rule in the grammar. Hence grammars containing many rules can be hard to manage and maintain.

### How to run ?
