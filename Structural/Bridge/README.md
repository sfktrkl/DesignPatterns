## When to use Bridge Pattern ?

- When you want to divide and organize a monolithic class that has several variants of some functionality (for example, if the class can work with various database servers).
- When you need to extend a class in several orthogonal (independent) dimensions.
- If you need to be able to switch implementations at runtime.

## Advantages of Bridge Pattern

- Platform-independent classes and apps.
- The client code works with high-level abstractions. It isnâ€™t exposed to the platform details.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new abstractions and implementations independently from each other.
- Single Responsibility Principle. You can focus on high-level logic in the abstraction and on platform details in the implementation.

## Disadvantages of Bridge Pattern

- You might make the code more complicated by applying the pattern to a highly cohesive class.

### How to run ?

- Run `TestRemote.java`.
