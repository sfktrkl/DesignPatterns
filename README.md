# Design Patterns

A design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.

## Benefits of Design Patterns

Design Patterns,

- Can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.
- Improve code readability for coders and architects familiar with the patterns.
- Provide general solutions, documented in a format that doesn't require specifics tied to a particular problem.
- Allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions.
- Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems.

## Types of Design Patterns

### Creational Design Patterns

These design patterns are all about class instantiation.

- Abstract Factory
  > Creates an instance of several families of classes
- Builder
  > Separates object construction from its representation
- Factory Method
  > Creates an instance of several derived classes
- Object Pool
  > Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
- Prototype
  > A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
- Singleton
  > A class of which only a single instance can exist

### Structural design patterns

These design patterns are all about Class and Object composition.

- Adapter
  > Match interfaces of different classes
- Bridge
  > Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
- Composite
  > A tree structure of simple and composite objects
- Decorator
  > Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- Facade
  > A single class that represents an entire subsystem
- Flyweight
  > A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
- Private Class Data
  > Restricts accessor/mutator access
- Proxy
  > An object representing another object

### Behavioral design patterns

These design patterns are all about Class's objects communication.

- Chain of responsibility
  > A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
- Command
  > Encapsulate a command request as an object
- Interpreter
  > A way to include language elements in a program
- Iterator
  > Sequentially access the elements of a collection
- Mediator
  > Defines simplified communication between classes
- Memento
  > Capture and restore an object's internal state
- Null Object
  > Designed to act as a default value of an object
- Observer
  > A way of notifying change to a number of classes
- State
  > Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
- Strategy
  > Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
- Template method
  > Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
- Visitor
  > Defines a new operation to a class without change
