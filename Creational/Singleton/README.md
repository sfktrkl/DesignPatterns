## When to use Singleton Pattern ?

- When you want to eliminate the option of instantiating more than one object.

## Advantages of Singleton Pattern

- Offers the guarantee that only one instance of our class exists and reduces the risk of unexpected behavior in our program.

## Disadvantages of Singleton Pattern

- Life cycle management can pose problems in other areas such as testing since the singleton class is kept alive during the lifespan of the application and different test cases might require new versions of the class.

### How to run ?
