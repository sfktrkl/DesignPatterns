## When to use Abstract Factory Pattern ?

- When your code needs to work with various families of related products, but you don’t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products

## Advantages of Abstract Factory Pattern

- Being able to have objects interact through common interfaces.
- Products you’re getting from a factory are compatible with each other.
- Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new variants of products without breaking existing client code.

## Disadvantages of Abstract Factory Pattern

- The code may become more complicated than it should be, since a lot of new interfaces and classes are introduced along with the pattern.
